OVERVIEW OF THE PEOJECT


Poject:Create a Python program that acts as a basic calculator. 

Objective

Develop a simple command-line calculator program in Python.
The program should allow users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers.

Key Activities:

User Input:
Prompt the user to enter two numerical values.
Validate the user input to ensure they are valid numbers (float).
Operation Selection:
Prompt the user to choose the desired operation (+, -, *, /).
Validate the user input to ensure it's a valid operation symbol.
Calculation:
Based on the chosen operation, perform the corresponding mathematical calculation on the two numbers.
Handle division by zero error to prevent program crashes.
Output:
Display the result of the calculation in a clear and user-friendly format.

Technology Used:

Python: The program is written in Python, a general-purpose, high-level programming language known for its readability and ease of use.
Input/Output Functions: Python provides built-in functions like input() to get user input and print() to display output on the console.
Conditional Statements: The program uses if, elif, and else statements to control the flow of execution based on user input and operation selection.
Error Handling: The program includes a try-except block to handle potential errors like invalid user input (non-numerical values).
This is a basic calculator program that demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like user interaction, conditional statements, and performing calculations. It can be further extended to include more features like:

More complex mathematical operations (e.g., exponentiation, trigonometry)
Ability to handle expressions with multiple operations
User interface using libraries like Tkinter for a graphical calculator
